# Awesome Flowisitc
A curated list of books, libraries, apps and papers we love and use at <a href="https://flowistic.ai" target="_blank">Flowistic</a>. We work with innovative and high-performing companies and startups and help them build complex projects using Python, NLP & Machine Learning, Cloud and advanced computing.

# Overview

We create amazing products for ambitious and innovative companies & startups. We combine
the Python ecosystem with Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
technologies to create heavy backend apps with artificial intelligence
components. We follow agile methodologies in order to develop MVPs and full
products the lean way.

# Development Tools

## Python

### virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

A very useful development tool that lets us create isolated Python environments
for every project, isolating the set of libraries used in the project from the
system.

* [virtualenv][venv]
* [virtualenvwrapper][venv-wrapper]

[venv]: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

## iOS

### cocoapods

Package manager for iOS projects. Handle the setup and update of XCode projects
to speed up the integration of new components.

* [cocoapods][cocoapods]

### nomad

CLI for iOS projects. Has various tools to perform common task from the command
line (ex: generate, sign and ditribute OTA an ipa)

* [nomad][nomad]

## Other

### Vagrant

[Vagrant][vagrant] is a tool for creating isolated, reproducible development
environments using virtual machines. It is usually used with VirtualBox, but
supports VMWare and other virtualization systems.

### Docker

[Docker][docker] is a tool for creating and managing
[software containers][containers].

### Metamon

[Metamon][metamon] is a tool to automatically set up an isolated execution
environment for Django applications.

## Source Control

Just use [git][git]. A good resource is the [Pro Git][pro-git] book by Scott
Chacon, and [GitHub's help site][gh-help].

## Editors and IDEs

* [Emacs][emacs]
* [PyDev][pydev]

[emacs]: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

# Standards and Conventions

The [PEP8][pep8] is the definitive reference for Python coding style. The
[pep8][pep8-py] package can be used to scan code and find parts that don't
conform to the PEP8 standard.

With Emacs, the [emacs-pep8] package can be used to run the pep8.py script.

[pep8]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
[pep8-py]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8
[emacs-pep8]: https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/pep8

# Deploying

We use [Ansible][ansible] for all our deployment and server orchestration tasks.

[ansible]: http://www.ansible.com/home

# Databases

## Relational

Just use [Postgres][postgres]. It's not just a database, it's a complete
"relational database framework" that provides [full-text search][postgres-text],
[GIS][postgres-gis] and extensive documentation of every knob and lever.

[postgres]: http://www.postgresql.org/
[postgres-text]: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/textsearch.html

## NoSQL

Are you *sure* Postgres can't do what you want?

# Tech Stack

First things first: Machines are meant to be identical. [Ansible][ansible]
provisions your local [Vagrant][vagrant] box the same way it provisions a
server. This way the production environment is the same as the development one,
and we avoid hard to find bugs while being fairly certain that if something
works in dev, it will work in prod.

Specifically, machines look like this:

* The application is run inside a [virtualenv][venv], even if it's the only
  application in the server. This makes it easy to add other applications should
  the need arise, for instance, you might want to run an IPython Notebook server
  with a Notebook that provides some analytics and charts of the data in your
  database, without contaminating the app's environment with IPython's
  dependencies.

* [Nginx][nginx] is used as a reverse proxy, sending requests from the Internet
  to the Django server and responses the other way around. Nginx can take care
  of load balancing, caching, HTTP acceleration and some degree of security.

* [Supervisor][supervisord] is used to keep the actual application server
  running, as well as running other scripts or processes. Every process is
  logged to disk for debugging.

* [Postgres][postgres] is the database, of course.

Our tech stack looks roughly like this on most projects:

![Stack](https://rawgithub.com/tryolabs/awesome-tryo/master/stack.svg?raw=true)

This is, of course, an approximation. Some projects use NoSQL databases in
addition to relational ones, others use other things like message queues, some
use specific tools like [Varnish][varnish] instead of Nginx for HTTP
acceleration.
